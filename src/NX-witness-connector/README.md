# SmartFace to NX Witness Connector

Primary purpose of **SmartFace to NX Witness Connector** is to receive SmartFace action detection notifications (via ZeroMQ) and forward them to the NX Witness server as a `Generic Event`

Code servers also as a sample *How to integrate with SmartFace Notifications* and can be easily extended to other types of notifications

**Note**: For Action detection version `SmartFace v5_4.13` or higher is required
